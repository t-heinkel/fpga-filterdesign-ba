Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
ERROR: [Place 30-876] Port 'AC_GPIO2'  is assigned to PACKAGE_PIN 'AA6'  which can only be used as the N side of a differential clock input. 
Please use the following constraint(s) to pass this DRC check:
set_property CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE FALSE [get_nets {AC_GPIO2_IBUF}]
Resolution: Please use the xdc constraints above.
